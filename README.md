# Sort My Brain

Sort My Brain is a web-based journaling tool designed to help people gently organize their overwhelmed thoughts. You start with a freeform brain dump—just typing out whatever is in your head—and the app intelligently extracts your mood, a structured to-do list, and even offers a simple breathing exercise to help you ground yourself.

It’s a soft interface for busy, burnt-out, overstimulated brains. Like a composition notebook with a little bit of magic.

## Features

### Brain Dump
- Big open textbox for stream-of-consciousness journaling
- Accepts messy, emotional, honest input — no structure required


### Smart Sorting (Local Version)
- Uses JavaScript to detect common patterns in your thoughts
- Parses out your mood (e.g. anxious, tired, overwhelmed)
- Extracts a to-do list with subtasks from keywords
- Displays a breathing exercise prompt (4-7-8 method) for stress relief


### Clean, Cozy UI
- Nostalgic composition book cover intro screen
- Calming visual layout and conversational tone
- Gentle fallback messaging when input is unclear

## Why This Exists
This was born from the experience of being mentally overloaded, emotionally stuck, and needing a place to begin—not a productivity app yelling at you to “get more done.”

It’s for anyone who’s felt like:
- “I’m so behind on life.”
- “Everything feels too loud.”
- “I want to do better but I don’t know where to start.”

Sort My Brain is for you.
